# DataArt-Fibonacci-Prime

The program tries to find the next prime fibonacci number.
i.e. - given a input n, the `nextPrimeFibonacci` function returns a number which is both prime and fibonacci and is greater than the input number.

The program below is complete and works as detailed in the requirements.
The task here is to:

<ol>
<li>rationalize and understand the code as best you can.</li>
<li>open a PR to improve the code as you see fit.</li>
</ol>

Converting to an Angular app or typescript is not considered a necessity here.
We're mostly interested in understanding how engineers can critique the code & suggest improvements.
